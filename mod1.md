I have created a contract name FunctionAndError and then i created a function which takes the input from the user like address and amount and then check for the ownership using require() statement an then check for the available balance .if it is greater then the inputed amount using revert() statement, and if true then complete the transaction.

Atlast i have created assert() statement to check for any inside errors.
